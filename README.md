# Run the App

1. After cloning the app, run `yarn install`

2. Start the server with `yarn start`

3. Run the test with `yarn test`

> Note: you can click on the column label to sort the columns alphabetically, will need to implement better ui for it if spent more time

## TODOs for future

- Put `<Table>` in it's own component

- Save sorted objects so that they don't need to be resorted

- Make custom loading and error components

- Break bigger functions into smaller ones for separation of concern and easy debugging

- Add more test cases for sorting and filtering

- Add more styling(possibly adding packages like material-ui) to minimize back-breaking on css

- Adding some logos instead of the links, arrow indicator on columns based on the 0 or 1 state indicating sorting desc or asc, hover states, etc.

- Set up to handle large data set maybe utilizing lazy loading
